# Rust ML from scratch

This is a repo where i am trying to reproduce ML algorithms in Rust in order to learn Rust. The success of reproducibility is determined by the similarity of the weights between my Rust implementation and Python scikit-learn implementation.

## Data

Different datasets are generated for regression and classification. The data is generated by python scripts, where two datasets are created, a **simple** one with one independent variable and a more **complex** one with six features from which three are informative.


## Results

- [x] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
